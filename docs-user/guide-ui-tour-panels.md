# UI Tour

Get to know Firefox Profiler UI a bit better with a tour that highlights various features. The screenshots are all taken from [this profile](https://share.firefox.dev/3rRG46l).

## The panels

The timeline lists multiple threads, while the panels provide an analysis of the currently selected thread in the timeline. The panel only uses one thread at a time by default. However it's possible to merge several threads together by using the `Ctrl` keyboard key when clicking a thread.
